# Configuration

A config file is created from defaults whenever required. If you want to change settings, 
change the config.json file in the config directory. This will not be pushed to the
repository, so you can tweak settings without interfering other users.

Guidelines to add configuration fields:
- Use only lowercase letters in field names
- Use underscores to separate words in field names
