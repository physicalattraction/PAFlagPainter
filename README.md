# PAFlagPainter
Draw flags of the world, based on recipes

# How to use?
Run the script FlagRecipes to create all flags.

A config file is created from defaults whenever required. If you want to change settings, 
change the config.json file in the config directory. This will not be pushed to the
repository, so you can tweak settings without interfering other users.
